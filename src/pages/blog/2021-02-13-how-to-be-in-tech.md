Welcome to the first of my posts about **how to be in tech**. 

\
**Who am I?**

I'm Atty, a **front end web developer**. That means I take designs from designers and make websites look and work like those designs.

I've also studied **full-stack** web development, which means that I know how the web pages get the lovely things to show on the pages  - like pictures of mountains, or cats, or shoes, or metal detectors.

(Although you also do that as a front end developer).

I also know how to get files from my computer and put them on the internet, so everyone else can see them too (or maybe only the people that I want to). Let's not over-share).



**I'm not at the beginning of my web development career, nor at the end.** 

**My journey (that is how it feels) has looked like the picture.** 

I've studied and stumbled enough on my way here and I'd like to share as much as I can to make your start in tech easier.  If one other person out there gets some peace of mind (or a new job) from these posts, then we've won.\

**How to BE ... in tech?**

The fact that you're here indicates that you may, like me, have already read a lot of high-quality posts and articles about ***breaking into*** or ***getting into*** or ***jumping into*** tech. 

Many of these resources are **excellent** because they are brimming with useful, essential and tantalising information about how to start a tech career. I will be pointing you towards the ones that might be relevant to you and your wants.

I say **how to be in tech** because it can be helpful, when something is new, or daunting, to visualise yourself with one foot already in - ***being*** there - rather than poised on the edge of a diving board, plummeting towards the unknown or smashing through barriers. Exciting as that is.

**Who are you?**

You might have questions to be answered and problems that need untangling. (Clue: working in web development is basically untangling problems and making things look nice and work, sometimes even well)

**Whether it's your fourth time or your first, being in tech. If you have caring responsibilities, if you are from a background that makes it harder to access education, or whether you are looking for a new direction to unfold and challenge you in the later years of your life, my plan is to find resources to help you with your tech career and get you answers to your questions.**

What's your story?

So, how to **be** in tech.  Watch this space.
